Lung cancer's high mortality rate can be mitigated by early detection, which is increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) for diagnostic imaging. However, the performance of AI models is contingent upon the datasets used for their training and validation.

This project aims the development and validation of AI models for both nodule detection and cancer classification tasks. This benchmarking across multiple datasets establishes the DLCSD as a reliable resource for lung cancer AI research.
