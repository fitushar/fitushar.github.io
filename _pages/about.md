I am Fakrul Islam Tushar, PhD, a researcher in AI-driven medical imaging, trained at [Duke University’s Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.duke.edu/) and the [Center for Virtual Imaging Trials (CVIT)](https://cvit.duke.edu/). My research focuses on AI-driven multimodal medical imaging and digital twin technologies, aiming to advance personalized healthcare.

I hold an [Erasmus+ Master’s degree in Medical Imaging (MaIA)](https://maiamaster.udg.edu/), having studied across Spain, Italy, and France, and have contributed to impactful research at [Duke’s RAI Labs](https://rai.labs.duke.edu/). I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [AIUB](https://www.aiub.edu/), graduating Cum Laude and receiving the Dean’s Award.

My research has been supported by Erasmus+ and Duke University grants and recognized with multiple honors, including the Best Poster Award ([Virtual Imaging Trials in Medicine 2024](https://vitm.io/)) and a Travel Award from the [SPIE Medical Imaging Conference](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/medical-imaging) 2024. Beyond academics, I have been actively involved with organizations like IEEE, Teach For Bangladesh, and Literacy Through Leadership.
