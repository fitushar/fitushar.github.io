I am Fakrul Islam Tushar, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at [Duke University’s ECE Department](https://ece.duke.edu/)  and a Research Associate at the [Center for Virtual Imaging Trials (CVIT)](https://cvit.duke.edu/). My research focuses on AI-driven multimodal medical imaging and digital twin technologies, aiming to advance personalized healthcare.

I hold an [Erasmus+ Master’s degree in Medical Imaging (MAIa](https://maiamaster.udg.edu/), having studied across Spain, Italy, and France, and have contributed to impactful research at [Duke’s RAI Labs](https://rai.labs.duke.edu/). I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [AIUB](https://www.aiub.edu/), graduating with Cum Laude honors.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to receive Erasmus+ and Duke University grants, along with the AIUB Dean’s Award. Beyond academics, I have been actively involved with organizations like IEEE, Teach For Bangladesh, and Literacy Through Leadership. My work on lung cancer screening using AI-driven virtual imaging trials has been recognized with several awards, including the Best Poster Award at the [Virtual Imaging Trials in Medicine 2024](https://vitm.io/) and a Travel Award at the [SPIE Medical Imaging Conference](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/medical-imaging) 2024.
